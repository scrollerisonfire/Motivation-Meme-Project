The image fills the container width (width: 100%).

The heading uses text-transform: uppercase to automatically capitalize all letters.

The div is horizontally centered using width: 50% and margin-left: 25%.

Paragraph and heading are centered using text-align: center.

The font is loaded from Google Fonts in the <head> section.
